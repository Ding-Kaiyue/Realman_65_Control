## rm_gazebo_Package_Description
rm_gazebo is mainly used for realizing the simulation function of robot arm Moveit2 planning. We build a virtual robotic arm in the simulation environment of Gazebo, and then control the virtual robot arm in Gazebo through Moveit2. This package is introduced in detail in the following aspects.
* 1.Package use.
* 2.Package architecture description.
Through the introduction of this part, it can help you:
* 1.Understand the package use.
* 2.Familiar with the file structure and function of the package.

## rm_gazebo_Package_Running
### Control_of_the_simulation_robotic_arm
After the installation of the environment and the package, we can run the rm_gazebo package.  
Use the following command to launch the Gazebo virtual space and the virtual robotic arm.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_gazebo gazebo_65_demo.launch.py
```
The interface displays as follows after successful running.

Then, we use the following command to launch moveit2 to control the simulation robot arm in Gazebo.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_65_config gazebo_moveit_demo.launch.py
```
After the control interface of rviz2 pops up, you can perform the simulation control of moveit2 and Gazebo.
